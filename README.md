# EE319K - Introduction to Embedded Systems | Spring 2021
All class Lab Assignments and Homework Assignments in EE319K - Introduction to Embedded Systems
from Spring 2021 Semester

EE319K will continue the bottom-up educational approach, started in EE302 and EE306. The overall educational objective is to allow students to discover how the computer interacts with its environment. It will provide hands-on experiences of how an embedded system could be used to solve EE problems. The focus will be understanding and analysis rather than design. The analog to digital converter (ADC) and digital to analog converter (DAC) are the chosen mechanism to bridge the CE and EE worlds. EE concepts include Ohms Law, LED voltage/current, resistance measurement, and stepper motor control. CE concepts include I/O device drivers, debugging, stacks, FIFO queues, local variables and interrupts. The hardware construction is performed on a breadboard and debugged using a multimeter (students learn to measure voltage and resistance). Software is developed in ARM Cortex-M assembly and C; most labs will be first simulated then run on the real LM4F120/TM4C123 board. Software debugging occurs during the simulation stage. Verification occurs in both stages. Labs 1, 3, 4 are written in ARM assembly language. Labs 8 and 9 are written in a combination of assembly and C.  Labs 2, 5, 6 and 10 are written in C.
